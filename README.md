# Hello :)
That's a simple ***study*** project to improve a little bit of my knowledge about malwares

---

## What's the goals of that?
It must be a simple spyware. That takes target's screenshot, record their words, password, anything thats he's typin, 
took a his face photos, and all this in at N to N seconds. Using threads, to do all of this all the same moment

But isnt only this, in addition to catch 1 machine, i pretend to makes it a worm too (is not implemented yet)
going through his network and then catching connected machines too

Its something like a metepreter function? yeah it is
